            <h3>1. Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Start with a summary of the project. What was the goal? What problem were you trying to solve?
                This section should give the reader a high-level understanding of your work.

            <h3>2. Methodology</h3>
            <p>
                Describe the techniques and algorithms you used. For example, you might have implemented a Gaussian filter.
                You can even include LaTeX for equations like the 2D Gaussian function:
                $G(x, y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2}}$.
                Explain *why* you chose this approach.
            </p>
