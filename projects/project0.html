            <p>
                The second portrait is clearly more natural. The first selfie exaggerates facial features closest to the camera. By stepping back and zooming in, the portrait becomes more natural and facial proportions are compressed.

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>
                The telephoto image (Fig 3) appears "flattened." Objects in the foreground and background seem closer together than they actually are. This is **perspective compression**. Because the camera is far away, the large distances between objects along the path are small relative to the camera's distance. In the wide-angle shot (Fig 4), the camera is closer, which exaggerates the sense of depth and makes the path seem much longer.

                </figure>
            </div>

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>
                This effect works by combining two opposite actions. The physical movement of the camera (the "dolly") changes the perspective, altering the relative size and position of background objects. Simultaneously, adjusting the zoom (focal length) counteracts this movement to keep the main subject at a constant size. The result is a visually unsettling effect where the world seems to warp around a static subject.
