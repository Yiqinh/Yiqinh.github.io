            <h3>1. Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of this project is to develop an intuitive understanding of the relationship between perspective, camera distance, and focal length (zoom). By capturing specific scenes, we can observe how these factors influence the final image, from flattering portraits to dramatic cinematic effects.

            <h3>2. Part 1: Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h3>
            <p>
                For this part, I took two portraits. The first was a selfie taken from a very close distance with a wide-angle lens. The second was taken from several feet away, using zoom to make the face appear the same size in the frame.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Results</h4>

            </div>

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>
                The second portrait (Fig 2) is clearly more flattering. The distortion in the first selfie (Fig 1) is caused by **perspective**, not the lens itself. When the camera is very close, the relative distance between my nose and my ears is significant compared to the overall distance to the camera. This exaggerates the features closest to the camera. By stepping back and zooming in, I decreased this relative distance, resulting in a portrait with more natural, compressed facial proportions.

            <h3>3. Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h3>
            <p>
                This experiment reverses the procedure from Part 1. I first took a telephoto (zoomed-in) shot of a long path on campus. Then, I walked closer and took a wide-angle shot, framing the main subject to be a similar size.
            </p>

                </figure>
            </div>

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>
                The telephoto image (Fig 3) appears "flattened." Objects in the foreground and background seem closer together than they actually are. This is **perspective compression**. Because the camera is far away, the large distances between objects along the path are small relative to the camera's distance. In the wide-angle shot (Fig 4), the camera is closer, which exaggerates the sense of depth and makes the path seem much longer.

            <h3>4. Part 3: The Dolly Zoom (Vertigo Effect)</h3>
            <p>
                The dolly zoom is a famous cinematic effect that keeps a subject the same size in the frame while the background's perspective changes dramatically. To achieve this, I moved the camera backward away from a subject while simultaneously zooming in.
            </p>

            <h4>Result</h4>
            <div class="results-gallery">
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x450" alt="GIF of the dolly zoom effect">
                    <figcaption>Fig 5: An animated GIF showing the dolly zoom. The subject remains static as the background appears to rush away.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>
                This effect works by combining two opposite actions. The physical movement of the camera (the "dolly") changes the perspective, altering the relative size and position of background objects. Simultaneously, adjusting the zoom (focal length) counteracts this movement to keep the main subject at a constant size. The result is a visually unsettling effect where the world seems to warp around a static subject.
